theres of course more stuff like applyOperation() but that you're gonna have to learn yourself.

# Extra

in functions like sub() or div() we have a parent argument which is always the first. 

everything will be done to the parent argument which means if you set it to ten and set the next argument to 5 you will get 5.

since its 10 - 5

aswell after using an operation you have to add a toValue() at the end of it otherwise it will cause an error.

all toValue() functions:
- toInteger()
- toDouble()
- toFloat()
- toLong()
